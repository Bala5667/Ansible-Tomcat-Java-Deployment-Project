# Automated-NGINX-Installation-on-EC2-Using-Ansible

In this project, I implemented an automation pipeline using Ansible to install and configure the NGINX web server on a worker EC2 instance. The entire setup is orchestrated from a master EC2 instance, demonstrating the core concepts of configuration management, remote execution, and secure infrastructure provisioning.
